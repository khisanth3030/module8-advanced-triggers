# Developer Kickstart: Advanced Trigger Techniques

This repository is an integral part of the Developer Kickstart curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. Designed specifically for budding Salesforce developers, this module delves deep into the realm of triggers, emphasizing advanced best practices, the utility of trigger helpers, and the integration of trigger frameworks.

## Goals of the Practice

During this repository, you will enrich your understanding of:
- The pivotal role of advanced trigger best practices in Apex and Salesforce development.
- Designing and implementing trigger helpers to modularize and simplify trigger logic.
- The architecture and utilization of trigger frameworks to create scalable and maintainable triggers.
- The significance of segregating logic into specific contexts (before, after, insert, update) to enhance trigger efficiency.
- The importance of bulkifying triggers to handle multiple records simultaneously, optimizing performance.

By mastering these advanced trigger techniques, you'll augment your capacity to craft sophisticated, efficient, and maintainable triggers. This solidifies your proficiency in harnessing the full potential of Apex triggers, a cornerstone for advanced Salesforce development.
